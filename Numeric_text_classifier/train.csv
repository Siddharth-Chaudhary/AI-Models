it is gorgeous, casual, unique and a closet must have!
i wore it for the first time to an nhl game with black jeans and a red tee and got tons of compliments.
it is a medium weight knit and so works well under a jacket in the cold winter months, will be perfect for early spring
as a stand alone jacket, and also in early fall!
a beautiful basic with a pretty accent ruffle that is sophisticated and adds just that little something special!

initially, the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front, but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.
